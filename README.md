# Lakeland-PBS-Kids
The goal is to keep it simple while allowing some customizability to the PBS Kids experience.

Using the `<iframe>`, provided by PBS, that grabs the PBS Kids player, we are implementing it on our own site with some customizations. This will allow us to keep users on our site, allow some control over what/how things are displayed, and allow for easy Google Anaglytics tracking if you choose to use it.

# Installation
Keeping it simple, just clone this repo in to the directory you'd like this to appear on the web server (e.g. ~/public_html/someDirectory/).
