# Self Hosted PBS Kids Page
The goal is to keep it simple while allowing *some* customizability to the PBS Kids experience.

Using the `<iframe>`, provided by PBS, that grabs the PBS Kids player, we are implementing it on our site with some customizations. This will allow us to keep users on our site, allow some control over what/how things are displayed, and allow for easy Google Anaglytics tracking if you choose to use it.

# Installation
Once your stations domain has been white listed by PBS digital support, just clone this repo (or download & extract the archive) in to the directory you want the module to appear (e.g. ~/public_html/someDirectory/).

Finally, take a look at `include/variables.php` and make the needed changes to brand this for your station.
